I was following the class slides(Week7a_Interactive) and noticed there was a pointerPressed and pointerReleased method so I used both when moving the pieces.
I then read the directions closer after and realised that was not required to do but I thought it turned out way cooler so I left it. 
So to move objects you must hold the mouse down and drag the object to where is desired. Way cooler! lol

This is still true for a4.^^
